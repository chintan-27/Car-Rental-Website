## To rent a car:
Inputs a date: and shows all the cars available on that date. We cannot rent a car twice on same day. We can just rent a car for a day.

It take us to confirmation page:

## To register a car simply fill a form:

## Things we can add:
1) Better frontend (more user friendly)
2) Take an address while registering the car, and while taking input of date just add an input of place and show the available cars nearby.If less cars are available show next nearest cars.
